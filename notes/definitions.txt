 
Decision trees and Random forests?

Decision tree is a type of supervised learning algorithm (having a pre-defined target variable) that is mostly used in classification problems. It works for both categorical and continuous input and output variables. In this technique, we split the population or sample into two or more homogeneous sets (or sub-populations) based on most significant splitter / differentiator in input variables.

Random Forest is a versatile machine learning method capable of performing both regression and classification tasks. It also undertakes dimensional reduction methods, treats missing values, outlier values and other essential steps of data exploration, and does a fairly good job. It is a type of ensemble learning method, where a group of weak models combine to form a powerful model.

How recall and precision are related to the ROC curve?

Recall describes what percentage of true positives are described as positive by the model. Precision describes what percent of positive predictions were correct. The ROC curve shows the relationship between model recall and specificity – specificity being a measure of the percent of true negatives being described as negative by the model. Recall, precision, and the ROC are measures used to identify how useful a given classification model is.
ROC curve shows how the recall vs precision relationship changes as we vary the threshold for identifying a positive in our model. The threshold represents the value above which a data point is considered in the positive class.
A ROC curve plots the true positive rate on the y-axis versus the false positive rate on the x-axis. The true positive rate (TPR) is the recall and the false positive rate (FPR) is the probability of a false alarm. Both can be calculated from the confusion matrix

What is P value? 

The p-value is the level of marginal significance within a statistical hypothesis test representing the probability of the occurrence of a given event. The p-value is used as an alternative to rejection points to provide the smallest level of significance at which the null hypothesis would be rejected.

Q. What is Homoscedasticity?

A. Homoscedasticity, or homogeneity of variances, is an assumption of equal or similar variances in different groups being compared. This is an important assumption of parametric statistical tests because they are sensitive to any dissimilarities. Uneven variances in samples result in biased and skewed test results.  In statistics, a sequence of random variables is homoscedastic if all its random variables have the same finite variance. 


Q. What is DBSCAN Clustering?

A. DBSCAN is a density-based clustering algorithm that works on the assumption that clusters are dense regions in space separated by regions of lower density. It groups ‘densely grouped’ data points into a single cluster. It can identify clusters in large spatial datasets by looking at the local density of the data points. The most exciting feature of DBSCAN clustering is that it is robust to outliers. It also does not require the number of clusters to be told beforehand, unlike K-Means, where we have to specify the number of centroids.

Q. What is box cox transformation?

A. A Box Cox transformation is a transformation of non-normal dependent variables into a normal shape. Normality is an important assumption for many statistical techniques; if your data isn’t normal, applying a Box-Cox means that you are able to run a broader number of tests.

How is kNN different from k-means clustering?

kNN, or k-nearest neighbors is a classification algorithm, where the k is an integer describing the number of neighboring data points that influence the classification of a given observation. K-means is a clustering algorithm, where the k is an integer describing the number of clusters to be created from the given data. Both accomplish different tasks.

Explain cross-validation?
It is a model validation technique for evaluating how the outcomes of a statistical analysis will generalize to an independent data set. It is mainly used in backgrounds where the objective is forecast, and one wants to estimate how accurately a model will accomplish in practice. The goal of cross-validation is to term a data set to test the model in the training phase (i.e. validation data set) in order to limit problems like overfitting and gain insight on how the model will generalize to an independent data set.
