## Introduction

A good workflow means better results and reproducible researchs. A first step is to work with a nice structure of files and folders. In this repository I want to show _my_ workflow, it is not the best (I know) and for this reason I want to improve it. First, I followed the icebreakeR guidelines, and that was my first attempt at creating an efficient working structure. Later, new libraries and tools and Python as Data Science language were appearing. This changes made me to modify the primary structure. Besides, tools as github force us to add files as README.md or .gitignore.

In an efficient workflow, there is no only a good structure of files and folders, something more is needed. I usually use a [kanban](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kanban) methodology. A brief description of a kanban methodology starts with the means of _kanban_ word. It is a Japanese word that means _cards_. Each card identifies one process: definition, aim, person assings to that process and deadlines. Further, each _kanban_ is in blackboard that usually is divided in three columns: **to do**, **doing** (or in process) and **done**. Others columns can be added if the process requires it. We can also add tags to each card: _urgent_, _document_, _question_, _validation_, ... These tags facilitate you to give priorities to each subprocess.

At this point I think github is a good tool to work with _kanban_. In each repository you can associate a project based on the _kanban_ methodology. Initially, in github each _kanban_ is associated with a problem or issue and allows you to follow its process.
